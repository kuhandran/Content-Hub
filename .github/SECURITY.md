# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security seriously and appreciate responsible disclosure of vulnerabilities.

### Private Vulnerability Reporting

GitHub has a built-in security advisory feature that enables private vulnerability reporting. **Please use GitHub's private vulnerability reporting** to safely disclose security issues.

To report a vulnerability:

1. Visit the [Security Advisories](../../security/advisories) tab in this repository
2. Click **"Report a vulnerability"**
3. Fill out the vulnerability report form with:
   - Vulnerability type
   - Location of the vulnerability
   - Detailed description
   - Proof of concept (if possible)
   - Impact assessment
   - Suggested fix (if you have one)

### Timeline

- We will acknowledge your report within **48 hours**
- We aim to release a patch within **7-14 days** of confirmation
- You will be credited in the security advisory (unless you prefer anonymity)

### Supported Versions

| Version | Supported          |
|---------|------------------|
| Latest  | :white_check_mark: |
| Older   | :x:                |

We recommend always using the latest version for security updates.

### Best Practices

- **Do not open public issues** for security vulnerabilities
- **Do not disclose vulnerabilities publicly** until a patch is available
- Provide as much detail as possible to help us understand and fix the issue
- Allow reasonable time for us to develop and release a fix

### Security Measures

We maintain security through:

- Regular dependency updates and security audits
- HTTPS-only deployment
- Environment-based secret management
- Database access control and encryption
- Input validation and output sanitization
- Rate limiting on sensitive endpoints
